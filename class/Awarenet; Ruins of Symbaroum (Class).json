				"There are certain spells that a mystic has studied extensively, so much that they can mitigate the corrupting influence of the familiar magic. At 1st level, you can select 2 cantrips and 1 leveled spell. When you cast a favored cantrip you gain no Corruption, and when you cast a leveled favored spell you gain Corruption equal only to the level of the spell. Each time you gain a level of mystic you can make more spells favored, as shown on the Mystic table under Favored Spells, the first number is the current amount of favored cantrips and the second number is for leveled spells. When you cast a favored spell at a higher level you add the new level as Corruption instead of the base level. For example, if you cast a favored 3rd level spell at 5th level, you gain 5 temporary Corruption instead of 3. Certain spells are poorly researched, unreliable, or on the edge of dark sorcery. These spells cannot be favored. Unfavored spells are marked with an asterisk (*) in the spell lists found beginning on page 187."
