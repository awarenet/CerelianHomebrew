These mysteries are taught to those trusted by the order, or to its members who have achieved much in their battle against Corruption. With knowledge of these secrets a Staff Mage truly becomes one with their staff. You gain the following three abilities: • Mastery. Twice per day you may invoke your mastery over your staff by using an action to magically fix it in place. Until you spend an action to release the staff it will not move, even if it is defying gravity. Whilst under this effect the staff may hold up to 8,000 lbs of weight. More weight than this causes the staff to release and fall. A creature can make a DC 30 strength check, moving the staff 10 ft. on a success. You must be able to see your staff and be within 100 ft. of it to be able to activate this feature. • Unity. As a bonus action you may fuse your staff with your own body, drawing it into yourself. Whilst fused in this manner the staff weighs nothing and cannot be detected or discovered by other creatures. As another bonus action you call forth your staff causing it to grow from your palm ready to be used. After the first hour of being fused with you, any permanent Corruption begins to be drawn to you. At the end of the second hour the staff loses a point of permanent Corruption and you gain that point. This effect continues each hour until the staff has no permanent Corruption left. • Strength. You draw vigor from wielding your staff, whilst you are touching your staff you have advantage on saving throws against poison and diseases. In addition, while you are wielding your staff as a weapon, you have advantage on ability checks to resist being pushed or knocked prone. You are a master of stealth and thievery. You might focus on being flexible and fast, or disappearing into darkness or surprising folks in combat."

He has proposed Agrathor or Ergatharor as possible pronunciations. Light fell through cracks in the ceiling, dancing with the dust that covered everything in the room \u2013 the bottles of elixirs, poorly preserved monster trophies and the matron herself, an aged changeling. It was Kasimer who had led them to the cabin. Agniesha remained by the door, apparently uneasy. Gormyx spoke for the group, partly because the steady voice of the troll singer made him a great negotiator, partly because he knew more about the Underworld than the rest of them combined. Knowledge of the Abyss was undoubtedly relevant in the situation; their nemesis had fled there after the confrontation and the group had decided to hunt him down. It looked as if the troll and the changeling had already agreed on a price for a number of items and elixirs, but they were still squabbling over a brew that the matron claimed could provide anyone with armor-like skin, claws and even wings. Gormyx was just about to present a new argument when Jela heard herself cry out, \"I'll take it!\" The others gave her puzzled looks. In a calmer voice she explained, \"I'll take it. I'd rather die than allow the black priest to escape again!\" This section provides resource information that you'll use during character creation and play. We first cover the economy of Ruins of Symbaroum, including listings of common equipment, weapons, armor, services, elixirs, lesser artifacts, traps, entertainment and trade goods. This helps with building the setting and giving you, the player, a strong handle on what is available. The next section is a listing of all of the spellcasting traditions and the spells available to them at each casting level. This listing includes standard OGL spells, modified OGL spells and brand-new Symbaroum-only spells. The last section provides detailed information on any of the OGL spells that were modified to fit Ruins of Symbaroum and all of the new spells. It is provided in order by casting spell level and then alphabetically within each level, allowing you to find a spell of an appropriate level quickly."
