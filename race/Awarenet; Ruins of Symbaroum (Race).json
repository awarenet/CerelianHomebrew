				"It is believed that the elves of Davokar have always abducted human children and left changelings in their stead. Such children are called Abductees, and the reasons for them being taken have varied. Initially it was to learn more about and better understand humans; later the motive changed to wanting to foster ambassadors who understood the elves and could live among the clanfolks and teach them elven wisdom. Nowadays (in the elven sense, meaning within the last century), there has been an increasing need for warriors within the Iron Pact \u2013 to replace elves fallen in battle, and to offset the growing number of elves that do not survive their first dormancy (see page 58); the darkening of Davokar causes fewer and fewer elves to wake to their summer phase. Hence, it is not uncommon to see abducted humans hunt and fight alongside summer elves in the warbands of the Pact. The elves have long since known that abductees are loyal and good learners, but much to their surprise some of them have also proven capable of wisdom. Very few elves would ever admit this; to most elves the abducted humans are almost akin to faithful pets, useful and absolutely possible to love, but never to be regarded as equals.",
