				"It is believed that the elves of Davokar have always abducted human children and left changelings in their stead. Such children are called Abductees, and the reasons for them being taken have varied. Initially it was to learn more about and better understand humans; later the motive changed to wanting to foster ambassadors who understood the elves and could live among the clanfolks and teach them elven wisdom. Nowadays (in the elven sense, meaning within the last century), there has been an increasing need for warriors within the Iron Pact \u2013 to replace elves fallen in battle, and to offset the growing number of elves that do not survive their first dormancy (see page 58); the darkening of Davokar causes fewer and fewer elves to wake to their summer phase. Hence, it is not uncommon to see abducted humans hunt and fight alongside summer elves in the warbands of the Pact. The elves have long since known that abductees are loyal and good learners, but much to their surprise some of them have also proven capable of wisdom. Very few elves would ever admit this; to most elves the abducted humans are almost akin to faithful pets, useful and absolutely possible to love, but never to be regarded as equals.",

				"That the elves sometimes steal a human child from its crib and place a changeling in its stead has been known amongst the barbarians for as long as the witches can remember. Since the arrival of the Ambrians, changelings have started to emerge among them as well. While a rare occurrence, it is still a traumatic experience for every family affected. It is unknown what exact purpose the elves have for doing this, but Ordo Magica's catalog of known cases in Ambria implies that children have been taken throughout the entire population, literally from both high and low.",
				"A changeling looks human during childhood and starts to develop more elf-­like features in their adolescent years, though without ever becoming an elf in the true sense of the word. A changeling reaches adulthood at approximately the same age as a human; the changeling then continues to live a long life but apparently without taking any further steps in the life-­cycle of the elves. This has made some scholars develop theories stating that changelings are a people of their own, created by elven magic. Others claim that changelings indeed are elf-­spawn but that their natural life-­cycle has been truncated in some mystical way by growing up among humans.",
				"A changeling's lot in life is usually a hard one, since few of them are allowed to stay with their families when their true nature has been revealed. Changelings are sometimes taken in by witches or wizards to serve as assistants, but most of them end up on the street where they have to fend for themselves as best they can. Exiled from human society, the changeling wanders a long and lonely road, often bitter and dark minded, in other cases frivolous and indifferent to the hardship of others.",

				"The short and wiry people humans call dwarves have a history shrouded in mystery. Looking at the dwarves settled in Yndaros, they display no interest in the history of their kind; they are a people on the move, aimed towards the future, fleeing a dark past that has given them a sense of community, but without peace or meaning. The dwarven perspective is rooted in the sanctity of the family, the secrets of the spoken word and the conviction that the world is their common enemy. Gamalga of Kadizar, a sage interested in dwarves, is said to have stated that: \"The family is their shield, the language their weapon and the world their battlefield.\"",
				"Gamalga also spoke of the origin of the dwarves. After many fruitless conversations with the dwarves in Yndaros and at the fortress Küam Zamok, Gamalga realized that she would get better answers from elves and trolls, and that they claimed to have never met dwarves before the fall of Symbaroum. They were most likely created in the old empire and Gamalga summarizes her meager findings as follows: \"They emerged as worms in the rotting carcass of the World Serpent and were given wit by Symbaroum's sorcerers, to make them better slaves. However, the birth of the people forever bound them to the world and its fate, and because of this bond they early on developed a forceful counterculture which still marks them. The ancestral mothers and fathers of the dwarves created a language with hidden codes and secret double-­meanings, so intricate that not even the masters could understand. The dwarves never wrote anything down, since texts could be read, interpreted and even de-coded by the lords of Symbaroum. The dwarves kept their dreams to themselves and their voices echoed with the fate of the world.",
				"Both elves and trolls confirm that there is power inherent in some dwarven speech, and imply that those who made the dwarves, Symbaroum's princes, in time learned to hate their creations and fear the power contained in their language. After the fall of Symbaroum, the chronicle of the dwarven people describes an arduous journey in the shadow of death, continuously attacked and hunted by others. Nowadays, the descendants of the few who survived Symbaroum's ruin have spread to many places and their fates are seemingly very different.",
				"Apparently, the families in Yndaros are members of a once ruling elite in Küam Zamok, cast out after a bloody revolution \u2013 hence, the organized villains encountered in Ambria's capital are in fact dwarven nobles, used to ruling and giving orders, but incapable of creating even the most essential items themselves. More dubious scraps of information say that their inability to get along has to do with the order of succession in the realm they left behind, and the right to a throne which none of them will ever conquer.\"",
				"The people of Ambria have formed their opinions based on the dwarves in Yndaros, and they are not a very welcoming sort. They demand nothing of others, other than being allowed to mind their own business. To dwarves, the will of the family \u2013 as interpreted by the elders \u2013 is superior to the will of the individual, meaning that they often appear to have two sets of moral standards: one strictly coded and aimed at the family; another aimed at outsiders and often described as \"a lack of morality\" by their neighbors \u2013 since actions which only affect outsiders have no bearing on the internal family relations.",
				"The speech of the Yndarian dwarves is still today so intricate and filled with codes, double-­meanings and obscure idioms that their everyday conversations are close to unintelligible to bystanders, no matter how learned. It is also true that their voices have a particular power that some individuals know to make use of. Furthermore, their memory-­techniques are highly developed, making it possible for them to run complex \"businesses\" in Yndaros without writing down a single number or word.",
