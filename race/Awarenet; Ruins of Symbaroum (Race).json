				"It is believed that the elves of Davokar have always abducted human children and left changelings in their stead. Such children are called Abductees, and the reasons for them being taken have varied. Initially it was to learn more about and better understand humans; later the motive changed to wanting to foster ambassadors who understood the elves and could live among the clanfolks and teach them elven wisdom. Nowadays (in the elven sense, meaning within the last century), there has been an increasing need for warriors within the Iron Pact \u2013 to replace elves fallen in battle, and to offset the growing number of elves that do not survive their first dormancy (see page 58); the darkening of Davokar causes fewer and fewer elves to wake to their summer phase. Hence, it is not uncommon to see abducted humans hunt and fight alongside summer elves in the warbands of the Pact. The elves have long since known that abductees are loyal and good learners, but much to their surprise some of them have also proven capable of wisdom. Very few elves would ever admit this; to most elves the abducted humans are almost akin to faithful pets, useful and absolutely possible to love, but never to be regarded as equals.",

				"That the elves sometimes steal a human child from its crib and place a changeling in its stead has been known amongst the barbarians for as long as the witches can remember. Since the arrival of the Ambrians, changelings have started to emerge among them as well. While a rare occurrence, it is still a traumatic experience for every family affected. It is unknown what exact purpose the elves have for doing this, but Ordo Magica's catalog of known cases in Ambria implies that children have been taken throughout the entire population, literally from both high and low.",
				"A changeling looks human during childhood and starts to develop more elf-­like features in their adolescent years, though without ever becoming an elf in the true sense of the word. A changeling reaches adulthood at approximately the same age as a human; the changeling then continues to live a long life but apparently without taking any further steps in the life-­cycle of the elves. This has made some scholars develop theories stating that changelings are a people of their own, created by elven magic. Others claim that changelings indeed are elf-­spawn but that their natural life-­cycle has been truncated in some mystical way by growing up among humans.",
				"A changeling's lot in life is usually a hard one, since few of them are allowed to stay with their families when their true nature has been revealed. Changelings are sometimes taken in by witches or wizards to serve as assistants, but most of them end up on the street where they have to fend for themselves as best they can. Exiled from human society, the changeling wanders a long and lonely road, often bitter and dark minded, in other cases frivolous and indifferent to the hardship of others.",

				"The short and wiry people humans call dwarves have a history shrouded in mystery. Looking at the dwarves settled in Yndaros, they display no interest in the history of their kind; they are a people on the move, aimed towards the future, fleeing a dark past that has given them a sense of community, but without peace or meaning. The dwarven perspective is rooted in the sanctity of the family, the secrets of the spoken word and the conviction that the world is their common enemy. Gamalga of Kadizar, a sage interested in dwarves, is said to have stated that: \"The family is their shield, the language their weapon and the world their battlefield.\"",
				"Gamalga also spoke of the origin of the dwarves. After many fruitless conversations with the dwarves in Yndaros and at the fortress Küam Zamok, Gamalga realized that she would get better answers from elves and trolls, and that they claimed to have never met dwarves before the fall of Symbaroum. They were most likely created in the old empire and Gamalga summarizes her meager findings as follows: \"They emerged as worms in the rotting carcass of the World Serpent and were given wit by Symbaroum's sorcerers, to make them better slaves. However, the birth of the people forever bound them to the world and its fate, and because of this bond they early on developed a forceful counterculture which still marks them. The ancestral mothers and fathers of the dwarves created a language with hidden codes and secret double meanings, so intricate that not even the masters could understand. The dwarves never wrote anything down, since texts could be read, interpreted and even de-coded by the lords of Symbaroum. The dwarves kept their dreams to themselves and their voices echoed with the fate of the world.",
				"Both elves and trolls confirm that there is power inherent in some dwarven speech, and imply that those who made the dwarves, Symbaroum's princes, in time learned to hate their creations and fear the power contained in their language. After the fall of Symbaroum, the chronicle of the dwarven people describes an arduous journey in the shadow of death, continuously attacked and hunted by others. Nowadays, the descendants of the few who survived Symbaroum's ruin have spread to many places and their fates are seemingly very different.",
				"Apparently, the families in Yndaros are members of a once ruling elite in Küam Zamok, cast out after a bloody revolution \u2013 hence, the organized villains encountered in Ambria's capital are in fact dwarven nobles, used to ruling and giving orders, but incapable of creating even the most essential items themselves. More dubious scraps of information say that their inability to get along has to do with the order of succession in the realm they left behind, and the right to a throne which none of them will ever conquer.\"",
				"The people of Ambria have formed their opinions based on the dwarves in Yndaros, and they are not a very welcoming sort. They demand nothing of others, other than being allowed to mind their own business. To dwarves, the will of the family \u2013 as interpreted by the elders \u2013 is superior to the will of the individual, meaning that they often appear to have two sets of moral standards: one strictly coded and aimed at the family; another aimed at outsiders and often described as \"a lack of morality\" by their neighbors \u2013 since actions which only affect outsiders have no bearing on the internal family relations.",
				"The speech of the Yndarian dwarves is still today so intricate and filled with codes, double-­meanings and obscure idioms that their everyday conversations are close to unintelligible to bystanders, no matter how learned. It is also true that their voices have a particular power that some individuals know to make use of. Furthermore, their memory-­techniques are highly developed, making it possible for them to run complex \"businesses\" in Yndaros without writing down a single number or word.",

				"The elves of Davokar are but an offshoot of a greater people; part of a holy guardian order. Initially, the order involved elves from the virgin regions to the west, where humans have not yet reached and where the elven civilization is in bloom. Unlike humans, an elf's long life is interrupted by periods of dormancy wherein the elf grows into the next stage of their life-­cycle. Most elves encountered are in their summer cycle, the second phase of elven life. See the Ruins of Symbaroum Bestiary on page 172 for more information.",
				"A majority of the elves in Davokar were born into the order. This order \u2013 known by humans as the Iron Pact \u2013 is tasked with preventing the evil that slumbers beneath Davokar's roots and moss from awakening and spreading across the world. They have never been west and will never go there; to them the elven lands of old are and remain a dream that will never come true. From when they are young, they are told that their duty lies in Davokar and that they are not welcome in the old lands. The Iron Pact even has a ceremony to initiate young elves into the order, where weeping elders \u2013 led by Prince Eneáno \u2013 beg newly awakened summer elves for forgiveness for having forced them to be born, live and die in the Forest of the Death Shadow, Davokar. The life of the pact members is dangerous, their numbers are dwindling and the once so mighty Prince Eneáno is entering his soul's winter \u2013 the increasing unpredictability of the Prince has made it possible for other, disagreeing leaders to position themselves for the upcoming power struggle. The dispute concerns the tactics of the battle against the dark \u2013 whether it should be fought with arrows and spears or by forging alliances.",
				"The spirited fairies who wake up after their first dormancy enter the phase of the summer elves, and it is they who constitute the backbone of Davokar's guardian force: vigilant hunters armed with spears and bows. Many of them die in battle with abominations or taboo-­breakers from the less and less cautious humans in the south. Those who survive eventually reach their second dormancy, a time of tearful grief for the elves. The members of Davokar's Iron Pact all live with the bitter truth that few elves will ever awaken from their second slumber; most wither away before reaching the next life phase.",
				"Perhaps it is for this reason that the holds and forest castles of the Iron Pact always echo with sorrowful songs, lamenting the fallen and withered. Davokar's elves grow fewer and fewer; not even the ever increasing number of abductions can fill the gaps in their ranks. There is, however, a faint light in the gloom: more and more humans are willingly seeking to join the Iron Pact, and the elves working for alliances point out that there are even Ambrians among them.",

				"According to the scholars of Ordo Magica, the people of Ambria and Davokar are descendants of the same tribe, although the barbarians and the Queen's Folk hardly consider themselves so closely related. Queen Korinthia's claim to Ambria, the land south of Davokar forest, is motivated by her ancestral connection to the region, and even the most novice of Ambrian linguists can explain in what ways the \"gibbering speech of the barbarians and the melodious tongue of the Queen's Folk are similar.\" More disputed are claims saying that the two peoples originate from the same stem, rooted in the old and long forgotten empire of Symbaroum whose ruins are hidden deep within Davokar.",
				"Whatever the case, there are significant differences between the two peoples in a cultural sense. The Ambrians abandoned their blighted homeland Alberetor twenty years ago, to settle down in the well-­preserved ruins of Lindaros. On their journey they brought along their architecture, knowledge, economic system and social hierarchies. Thanks to its discipline the Ambrian army outmatches the barbarian clan warriors when they meet in the open fields, but in the woods where the skill of the individual becomes a decisive factor they are more evenly matched. That, coupled with the advantage of having greater local knowledge, has so far kept the Ambrians from entering very deep into the forest \u2013 with the exception of treasure-­hunters, religious fanatics searching for lost sun temples and free settlers hoping to escape the Queen's control.",
				"Since the days of old, the barbarians have been ruled by chieftains, but enjoyed much greater independence and freedom compared to the chastened crofters and peasants in the south. Nor do the barbarian leaders seek to enforce a strict or rigid way of life upon their subjects. The witches, the spiritual leaders among the barbarians, rule with a light hand in the form of taboos and general rules \u2013 revere nature, never abuse it and avoid the darker parts of the forest. The clans lead their lives independent from one another, with the occasional exception of skirmishes over resources in the border regions. By tradition, the clan leaders answer to the High Chieftain on the plateau of Karvosti, but he is in reality more of an arbitrator between feuding clans than a strong ruler. However, the High Chieftain is expected to lead the united barbarians to repel any invaders, particularly the Ambrians, if it ever comes to open war.",
				"This possibility, a united barbarian resistance commanded by the High Chieftain, gives the Queen and her advisors nightmares, and would explain why the Ambrians officially are so cautious regarding Davokar. Since the battle in Year 10, when Korinthia's troops attacked and destroyed Haloban and his Jezites, only the Templars serving the Sun Church have made any outright attacks against barbarian settlements. Most infamous is their assault on Karvosti in Year 16 when they attempted to seize the plateau with force of arms \u2013 an attempt which ended in a discouraging defeat.",
