				"The making of artifacts is a highly sought-after art form that for a long time was lost to elves and humans. How- ever, among the trolls it has been kept alive, as an almost sacred practice. Lately, the knowledge has been revived by humans and elves, in both cases thanks to the trolls of Davokar. The elves received it as a gift from a former ally, to aid them in these dark days, but how Ordo Magica managed to get their hands on the lost art is not known. However it happened, the knowledge has spread so that every chapter soon will have at least one artifact crafter in its service. The sudden reemergence of artifact crafting among mystics has made others question the source of the knowl- edge. One belief is that the Ambrian mystics have stolen it from the trolls \u2013 maybe even captured and tortured a troll \u2013 while others suspect that the rulers of the Under- world have traded this gift in exchange for something very valuable. What version lays closest to the truth is not easily guessed and the Grand Master refuses to speak on the topic."

Whether this is true or not, there occasionally are individuals who either choose or are forced to study on their own, or in smaller groups. Independent mystics are not burdened with the theories of a traditions, which gives them more freedom in their choice of powers. However, they are also much more vul- nerable to Corruption. Many untamed mystics tend to evolve their own understanding of the world and come to espouse theories that contradict those of the established traditions."

				"The character is one of those who are arrogant or des- perate enough to cling to the darkness. While other mystical traditions do everything they can to avoid the soul-eroding powers of Corruption, the Sorcerer chooses to do the opposite. The legends are teeming with sorcerers: mystics who draw their power from musty wellsprings or gain their corrupt gifts from creatures of evil. It is harder to find them in the real world, but those who know how to read the Shadows can sense their presence or see traces of their tainted work. Korinthia's people faced the undead servants of the Dark Lords during The Great War, and while the Dark Lords per- ished, their parasitic powers continued to drain the life out of Alberetor, forcing the Ambrians to flee north. There they instead faced the blighted creatures of Davokar, born from another kind of evil that festers in the fallen ruins of ancient Symbaroum. Sorcery is the mystical tradition that comprises powers and rituals fueled by Corruption and taint, whose usage provides power in the short run, but corrodes the mystic's body and soul in the long run. Theurgs active among the Twilight Friars gather rituals of sorcery as well as blight- stricken artifacts in an attempt to understand this new, dark enemy. Within their monastery in the Titans, it is said that the Black Cloaks hide dark vaults oozing with corruptive energies and echoing with the lamentations of the poor, tainted souls kept there for study."

And, sometimes, this may be true, though most cult members are only useful to their leader as scapegoats or sacrifices. Still, some become acolytes, the first true step on the path of sorcery. Changelings and others who already display magical affinities can become an acolyte directly. All such students must be wary \u2013 while their master has much to teach them, the master might also feel threatened by a too- successful acolyte and decide to feed them to an abomina- tion. Still, the most powerful rituals require a great amount of concentrated effort that only acolytes can provide, so the Sorcerer needs their students, just like the student needs their master. At some point, an acolyte will decide they know enough and wish to escape their master before they find themselves on the sacrificial altar. If they are successful then they may give themselves the title Sorcerer and begin to collect their own followers. If they fail, well perhaps their blood will be useful for the next ritual."

To fight Corruption is like pretending that death does not exist. Better to know it, and learn how to understand and use it as much as possible before everything meets its fated end. To walk side by side with darkness is a precarious act of balance, to say the least. Not to give in to darkness is the key, for doing so would surely mean being completely devoured. Wise Sorcerers accept Corruption, and exploit it, while still keeping a distance from its cold embrace, for as long as they possibly can."

				"The mystics called Staff Mages have gotten their epithet from the rune covered staffs they always carry. A rune staff is an expression of the Staff Mage's strength as well as a powerful weapon \u2013 something that has led to some Wiz- ards of Ordo Magica calling them by degrading names like \"wand-throwers\" or \"broomsticks.\" To the Staff Mage, the staff is an extension of their soul and to experienced staff mages it may sometimes be difficult to tell where the mage ends and the staff begins; they are part of the same whole. Whatever you call them, Staff Mages are said to descend from an order of warrior monks, tasked with protecting until recent times that they became known to the people of the south; before that they only sought new recruits among the northern barbarian clans \u2013 individuals suited for an ascetic life in the shadow of death. Many of the potentials tended to be changelings. With the darkness spreading through Davokar, the Staff southerners and their realm. Hence, the plainly dressed sometimes be seen visiting Ambria's duchies and courts, hunting for novices and allies in the fight against the horrors haunting the ruins of Davokar. The Order of Staff Magic consists of a number of ascetic warrior monks who see themselves as descendants to the guard of Symbaroum's last emperor. The Staff Mages live in their castle deep inside the forest, in the wild parts of Davokar where ruins from the fallen empire constant- ly remind them of their past failure. According to their myths, the fall of Symbaroum was directly connected to the death of the emperor, and as his bodyguards it was their duty to keep him alive. Hence, in the minds of the staff mages, the fall of Symbaroum was their doing and with the destruction of the empire, darkness entered this part of the world. It is up to the now living Staff Mages to correct the errors finally resurrect the fallen empire. To fight against Corrup- tion they use their staff to capture and bind Corruption, but there is danger in this as well. They have a valuable ally in the Iron Pact; even if the mages are not official members of the pact, they often cooperate with the elves. However, the Iron Pact and the Staff Mages are not always in agreement, (or her) place on the legendary Throne of Thorns in Sym- bar \u2013 while the mages regard the emperor's death as the triggering factor, the elves remember the emperor himself as the root of all evil. Aside from attacking those who from ignorance or a hun- ger for power fraternize with the powers of Corruption, the Staff Mages continuously seek \"The descendant and right- ful heir of the last emperor\". The search is as difficult as it is frustrating, with many mages in serious disagreement regarding both how to orchestrate the search and how to define the target. Most Staff Mages prefer the more tangible combat against abominations, Sorcerers and the few trea- sure hunters who venture so far into Davokar that they get close to the heart of Symbaroum: the ruined city of Symbar and its empty throne."

Mages do not regard Cor- ruption as immoral in itself, but emphasize that the Cor- ruption of the mystic can become the enemy's weapon; all mages are taught that Sorcerers can use the mage's own Corruption against him or her, which is why Corruption must be avoided. The order also keeps older and darker lessons alive, les- sons that claim the careless use of mystical powers, rituals and artifacts not only affect the mystic who wields them, but also the surrounding world. As proof of this, they often refer to the deserted wasteland east of the Ravens \u2013 which at one time is said to have been flourishing farmlands and the cradle of humankind's first empire. And since the order, according to the mages, stems from the east, it is not unlikely that their moral tales on the importance of mystical restraint contain some grains of truth."

				"That symbols and signs have power is well-known and made use of in most mystical traditions, at least in rituals. Pure Symbolism is a tradition that almost solely builds its pow- er on symbols and signs. Symbolism was born in the east, beyond the Ravens, and fleeing mystics brought it to what is now Clan Vajvod's territory in Davokar. The symbolists predate the founding of Clan Vajvod, at least according to the rune-covered remnants that the clanfolks discovered when they first came to the area. Foremost among these remnants is the Azure Temple, built in blue stone brought to Vajvod from beyond the moun- tains and covered in runes carved by many generations of symbolists. Still today, the blue temple is the scene of the yearly Rune Meets, when new members are initiated into the tradition. Ambrian scholars suspect that Symbolism \u2013 strange, powerful and decadent \u2013 is a vital clue to understanding why the barbarians of eastern Davokar are in disagree- ment with Karvosti and its authorities, the Huldra and the High Chieftain. It may lead to an explanation as to why the themselves from Karvosti, and at the same time, are more open to outsiders than other clans, Clan Odaiova excluded. Rumor has it that Vajvod's Clan Chieftain, Zoltar the Old, has not a witch but a symbolist by his side, likely one trained at the Azure Temple in the heart of the river lands."

They suffer some Corruption when a symbol is activated, but less than the members of other traditions \u2013 as little as only one point in temporary Corruption per activated symbol.

				"Symbolism requires the creation of intricate and complex runes that contain and bind their magical power. Thus, a symbolist uses Intelligence for the spellcasting ability modi- fier. You learn spells from the Wizard tradition list. However, you do not cast most magic as a normal mystic, preparing and activating runes instead. You do cast cantrips and rit- uals as normal. You can favor cantrips as normal, but you use runes instead of normal spells otherwise. Each rune is equivalent to casting one spell at a chosen spell level (a symbolist cannot prepare a rune at a higher level than their maximum spell level). When the rune is ac- tivated, the spell is cast and you gain temporary Corruption equal to the spell's prepared level. An unfavored spell costs double the prepared level. You decide the spell's effective level while preparing the rune and cannot change the spell level when you activate the rune. You can activate the rune multiple times. Example: Thurnia, a symbolist, prepares hold monster, normally a 5th level spell. She decides to create a rune as if it were cast at 8th level (the maximum she can, as she is 15th level). When she activates the rune, it will affect four creatures and she will gain 8 temporary Corruption. At the beginning of a long or extended rest, you must choose one of your runes to lose potency. That rune cannot be used to cast a spell until it is prepared again. At the be- ginning of any rest, you can choose to destroy one or more runes, in order to prepare different runes. Runes can only be prepared during a rest. You may pre- pare four runes during an extended rest, two runes during a long rest and one rune during a short rest.

It is disputed among scholars and the learned whether witchcraft is older than theurgy or if it is the other way around. Either way, the gold- en age of theurgy is now.

It is not important to them which of the traditions came first and which is the oldest.

A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action. You can perform this a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus before needing to take a long or extended rest. At 9th level, any affected undead with a challenge rating equal to or lower than half your proficiency bonus (round- ed down) are destroyed instead of turned. Player charac- ters of the undead origin do not have a challenge rating and cannot be destroyed by this feature, though they can be turned."

				"Singing as a source of power has its most evident expres- sion in the troll-singing skalds, whose voices lay mysteries bare and win battles. Poetry and singing exist in all cul- tures, but they are most powerful among elves, dwarves and trolls \u2013 with the possible addition of ogres. In all of these diverse cultures, singing is often combined with physical attributes \u2013 most skalds are true warrior poets that lead their allies to victory using the great power of their voice and muscles. As a tradition, Troll Singing is as old as the race of trolls \u2013 at least, their collective memory remembers nothing be- fore the songs. According to myth, the troll race was created through the songs of the world, hummed by the spirits of air and dust, in rhythm with the tail of the World Serpent drumming against the bedrock. To trolls, the songs of the skalds together with the ham- mering of the smiths, and the warriors' clawing at the stone walls of the Abyss compose the great hymn of life. The troll culture, yes even the existence of a single troll, is unthink- able without the songs."

				"To willingly accept Corruption is unthinkable to most troll singers. Through the songs, the trolls remember the world as it was before the Corruption, long before humans arrived and started building their empires. When Sym- baroum grew dark from hunger and rapacity, the trolls welcomed the elven intervention; they supported the Iron Pact and contributed to the birth of Davokar. At least this is said in the songs. Nowadays, the trolls live beneath the woods in the Abyss where darkness broods; in cavities and caves it gathers in pools of malice. These birthplaces of abominations remind all trolls, singer or not, that the twilight or winter of the world has come. They also know that this twilight cannot be expelled by the eerie lights glowing in their underground halls; that this is a winter during which even the tempera- tures of the Underworld will not protect them from being bitten by the frost."

According to the mythology of the witches, there are places where these paths converge, such as the cliff of Karvosti deep within Davokar. Witchcraft is believed to be the oldest and most deeply rooted of the traditions. Some tutors at Ordo Magica even claim that witchcraft \u2013 despite its primitive flaws \u2013 forms the basis of theurgy, and because of this, both Theurgs and Wizards have the wise Witches of old to thank for under- standing the fundamental principles of magic."

The powers of wizardry come from disciplined studies into the fundamental laws of nature, and from insights re- garding how those laws can be used and controlled by sheer will and reason. It is a strenuous education, even without the boring everyday tasks that the novices must perform for their masters. Only half of those who begin their studies with Ordo Magica see them through, but those who prevail are rewarded with a deep understanding of the mysteries of wizardry. Wizardry grew out of early forms of theurgy, in a time when the people of Alberetor still worshiped the panthe- on of the Young Gods. Philosophers and scholars started to renounce the metaphysical ideas of the priesthood, in- stead regarding the laws of nature as independent from the machinations of deities. To the founders of wizardry, the Young Gods were seen as the creators of the world, but not its shepherds. Instead the world is regarded as being profoundly magical and not in need of any gods to function. Nor is the world meant to be worshiped, merely understood \u2013 and used."

Each order chapter (com- monly called \"Wizards' guild\") is governed by a Chapter Master, who represents Ordo Magica when dealing with the local authorities. Ordo Magica as a whole is headed by the Grand Master, stationed at the chapter in Agrella. The title of Arch Mage is no longer in use. Before The Great War the Grand Master of the organization was chosen from within the circle of Arch Mages. But since all Arch Mages perished in the war, the Grand Master is instead chosen by, and often from among, the acting Chapter Masters."

				"According to Ordo Magica, Corruption is largely misunder- stood, thanks to the sermons of hot-headed theurgs and the fairy tales of witches. It all comes down to a regulated response; a reaction that occurs when a mystic uses their power to affect nature. This is not that different from what happens when some- one jumps off the stern of a boat, simultaneously pushing the boat forward with the same amount of force that goes into the jump. If the jumper is reckless, he will drop into the water; if the jumper is careful, he will land on the dock with dry shoes."

				"At 3rd level, the character is educated and well-versed in the ways of the world: its cultures, history, languages and artifacts. For centuries heroes, monsters and kingdoms have come and gone and left behind powerful items and secret texts. This ability represents knowledge about such things. Through extensive studies a character with this ability knows not only the story of an object but also its properties and applications. • At 3rd level, you can attempt an Intelligence (Investiga- tion) check to determine the properties of a magic item. On a success, if it is a magic item, you learn its properties and how to use them, whether it requires attunement to use, and how many charges it has, if any. You learn whether any spells are affecting the item and what they are. If the item was created by a spell, you learn which spell created it. The DC is dependent on the kind of magic item: common (DC 10), uncommon (DC 13), rare (DC 16), very rare (DC 19), legendary (DC 22). Additionally, you are proficient in both human lan- guages (Ambrian and Barbarian). • At 6th level, your understanding of artifacts is extensive enough that you are not as affected by their corruptive power. You may reduce your cost of a single artifact's permanent Corruption by 1, to a minimum of 1. You also become proficient in the ungainly tongues of both elves and trolls. • At 9th level, you may cast spells of a level equal to or lower than your proficiency bonus directly from scrolls and such parchments. You gain advantage on saving throws against magical effects. You are proficient in the spoken and written language once used in Symbaroum and know many things about that realm's ancient people."
